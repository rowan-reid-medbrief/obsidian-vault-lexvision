## Now (Medbrief)

### MedBrief onboarding - MRI-133 independent research
- **Last touched:** 2026-06-18
- **Status:** Deep code-grounded Q&A walking the MedBrief sorting/annotation architecture, extending the MRI-133 picture. SALLi is wired into the MSR monolith as the "SortingAssistant" (`PreprocessDocument` `salli-1`/`salli-2`), gated to GP centre-type plus named-trust wildcards (Leeds / Mid Yorkshire / Mid and South Essex / `salli uat`). The sorted record set is a zip of per-stack PDFs with continuous pagination. Annotations bind to the re-ingested PAGE-LESS output bundle (collection docs via `SortingSessionExportPusher`), which is why notes/14 §11 sees zero paged annotated docs (structural, not a surprise). Solution shape unchanged: dual-anchor (Page.id + position) plus lineage plus bind-at-minting.
- **next:** Two things. (1) Send or refine the Teams message to Dion; key ask is whether sort ingestion REUSES the same Document row or COPIES it (decides annotation carry-over). (2) Fold these findings into `notes/14`. Continue from the Rowan to Dion to Rowan exchange.

### MedBrief onboarding - knowledge-share deck + branded pack
- **Last touched:** 2026-06-18
- **Status:** Built a 14-slide MedBrief-branded knowledge-share deck (how Rowan onboarded himself with Claude Code), hardened ~23->14 slides via a 4-critic /harden-plan pass (added verbatim show-don't-tell slides, a confidentiality scrub, a per-slide overflow budget). Rendered `onboarding-pack-v1.md` into a 46-page branded docx (Contents, per-section page breaks, inline-code->bold). Both in `output/`, scrubbed, committed. `medbrief-brand` now exercised for pptx and docx.
- **next:** Deliver the knowledge-share session from `output/knowledge-share-deck.pptx` (speaker notes in the `.md`); still open: resolve the brand palette (corporate teal/green vs product indigo #5E53D1) and get GDES-174 / brand masters to harden the skill's type scale and logo clear-space.

### Kumulus / MedBrief engagement (lexvision-poc)
- **Last touched:** 2026-06-12
- **Status:** Working doc renamed `Landing Pad.docx` → `Rowan Kumulus Research.docx` and hand-edited in Rowan's voice: patent and ADR/decision reference numbers removed, M3–M12 benchmark cells narrated (links kept), GLiNER/Presidio cells clarified, M2 typo fixed. ~15 voice patterns captured to `~/.claude/profile/writing-voice.md`. The `landing-pad.spec.json` generator is now stale; do NOT rebuild (would wipe manual edits).
- **next:** Send the corrected `Rowan Kumulus Research.docx` to Laura and Deon; confirm the 15 June 15:00 Dublin slot with João; retire/reconcile the stale Landing Pad generator (IDEAS.md); resolve the ~/.claude cross-machine divergence; chase the named residuals (Deon, NICE in writing, Agilio).

### Expert Sheet — Phase 2 dedup, pending USE_DB run + Chantel delivery
- **Last touched:** 2026-06-09
- **Status:** Phase 2 `scripts/detect_duplicates.py` built, validated, committed. Full AI adjudication (1,864 medium pairs) **intentionally gated on profile data** — Gemini has no new signal without specialty/location data. **Since (2026-06-04):** shared `OUTPUT_MODE`/`WORKING_FILE` env flags + non-overlapping column blocks (P1 P–U, P2 V–Z, P1.5 AA onward; commit `06cb9b5`); project restructured to `scripts/` + `data/{raw,interim,outputs}` + `docs/` + `deliverables/` with repo-root path anchoring + `README.md`/`requirements.txt` (commits `6a58c07`, `f6d3ddb`); 3 legacy outputs consolidated into canonical `data/outputs/experts_working.xlsx` via `scripts/combine_outputs.py` (commit `effe70a`). Works **on `main` only**. **Since (2026-06-05):** verified `experts_working.xlsx` faithfully consolidates all 3 phases (P1 cols Q–U 2,810 rows, P2 V–Z 5,480 rows, P1.5 AA–BF ~30-row test batch) and **deleted the 3 legacy output workbooks** — working file is now the sole canonical output. **Substantially finalised `deliverables/chantel_update_phase2.docx`** (commit `90d5703`): single side-by-side user-type model-comparison table (1 June `gemini-2.5-flash` vs 4 June `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` — newer model more cautious, 348 unknowns vs 252, +134 law firm); plain "Summary" with row-numbered real examples; new "Profiles" section; removed the pasted dup-score/keep scratch from below the sign-off. (Heads-up: discovered python-docx `doc.paragraphs` hides tables — the "Column W"/"Results" headings were never empty; new profile rule saved.)
- **SDD assessment + pytest gate (2026-06-05):** Assessed Spec-First L1, gated at L0 by absent tests. Pytest recall gate **implemented** same session (commit `a4d6721`): 18/18 passing; project now Spec-Anchored. Run `venv/bin/pytest -v` to verify.
- **Next action:** (1) Finish the docx polish before sending — fix the broken sentence in the dup-detection intro ("…but since it focusses on… I wrote the script also catch…"), resolve the dangling "more on this below" in the Medium-tier bullet, tidy the pre-existing bold inconsistencies, and fill the `[SharePoint link]` placeholder. (2) Run USE_DB=true deterministic pass — open the jumpbox SSH tunnel first (command + `Not Found` fix now in `docs/DB_TUNNEL.md`; pre-staging port 3310), then `DEDUP_DRY_RUN=false DEDUP_ADJUDICATE=false DEDUP_USE_DB=true venv/bin/python3 scripts/detect_duplicates.py`. (3) Deliver `data/outputs/experts_working.xlsx` + the finalised docx to Chantel. (4) Confirm with Laura whether full profile generation is Rowan's scope (gates the AI adjudication step). Also open: triage the 348 Phase-1 unknowns.

## Now (Personal)

### Claude Code config modernisation: Phase A done, B/A6/C1 remain
- **Last touched:** 2026-06-07
- **Status:** Deep feature audit of the ~/.claude setup, hardened via /harden-plan into a lean-spine plan (gitignored at ~/.claude/plans/please-can-you-do-elegant-bubble.md). Phase A committed and pushed (30e5899, 89f8ef3): python3 status line (renders next session), `memory: user` on config-auditor and obsidian-curator with agent-memory/ gitignored first, /context pointers in wrap-up/handoff. Findings: fallbackModel is a `--fallback-model` CLI flag not a settings key; A5 SessionEnd dropped (no safe job). 7 high-priority remaining items in ~/.claude/docs/IDEAS.md (2026-06-07).
- **Next action:** Run Phase B (CLAUDE.md reclassify-and-trim) in a FRESH session: build the before/after adherence fixture FIRST (about 8 prompts plus negative probes that bait the wrong behaviour, run on a bare session), classify rules never-delegate vs may-delegate, keep safety/voice/account rules inline, target under 200 lines. Then the A6 sandbox pilot (keys in IDEAS.md) and the C1 auto-memory decision.
